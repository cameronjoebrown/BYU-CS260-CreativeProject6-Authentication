# BYU-CS260-creativeproject6-authentication

This is a project that I (Cameron Brown) made with another student in Fall 2018 for a web programming class (CS 260) at BYU.

In CS 260, creative projects were assignments where we could make any type of website we wanted as long as it
used the most recent principle we learned in class. On this particular creative project, we were supposed to use
some form of authentication to allow people to be able to signup for an account and login.

It was the first time, my partner or I had ever worked with authentication so it took us a while to get it working
and we were not able to make the content and design of the website very nice.
